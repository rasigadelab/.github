## Active projects

[**ResisTrack**](https://anr.fr/en/funded-projects-and-impact/funded-projects/project/funded/project/b2d9d3668f92a3b9fbbf7866072501ef-44177f4d60/)
uses multi-scale ecosystem modelling to understand the emergence and diffusion of antimicrobial resistance in hospitals.

[**EpiTrack**](https://presse.bpifrance.fr/arpege-obtient-un-financement-public-de-pres-de-9-me-pour-combattre-lantibioresistance) 
uses evolutionary-informed algorithms to scan hospital-wide microbiology diagnoses and detect epidemic clusters in real-time

[**COMEDIA-Lyon**](https://www.shape-med-lyon.fr/projets-structurants-vague-1/comedia-lyon/) is a One Health initiative to gather and analyze fine-grained
data relevant to antimicrobial resistance at the local scale of the Lyon Metropolitan Area, France.

## Involvement in other projects

[**ResTolTB**](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-22-CE15-0027) investigates the roles and dynamics of genetically encoded drug tolerance in drug resistance emergence in Mycobacterium tuberculosis
